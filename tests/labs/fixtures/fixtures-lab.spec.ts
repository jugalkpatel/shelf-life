/**
 * Green-by-default spec for the fixtures refactor lab.
 *
 * This file exercises every fixture in `fixtures.ts` and passes as
 * committed. As you refactor `fixtures.ts` (renaming, adding teardowns,
 * demoting helpers), update *this* spec to match. The refactor is not done
 * until this spec still passes against your changes.
 *
 * Do not change what each test is checking — only how it asks for the
 * setup. That discipline is what keeps the exercise about fixture design
 * rather than test rewriting.
